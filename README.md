# final-projectCIS-7
## General Description
This project is a simplified implementation of the popular casino card game, Blackjack, in C++. The program allows players to play against the dealer using a single deck of 52 cards. It provides functionality to display the dealer's and player's hands, calculate winning probabilities, and simulate hitting a card. The objective is to provide an interactive and realistic Blackjack experience.

## Programming Approaches
- Object-Oriented Design: The project uses classes and structures to model the game components, such as cards, deck, and hands. This approach promotes modularity, code organization, and extensibility.
- Simulation: The program simulates the game by calculating winning probabilities through multiple iterations with a shuffled deck. This approach provides statistical estimates of the likelihood of winning.
- Pseudorandom Shuffling: The program employs a pseudorandom shuffling algorithm to ensure card distribution and gameplay fairness.
